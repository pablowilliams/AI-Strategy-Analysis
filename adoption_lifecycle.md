# AI Adoption Lifecycle Model

A five-phase framework capturing the implementation roadmap for effective AI deployment in organisations.

## Phase Overview

### 1. Awareness Phase

The organisation evaluates AI opportunities, assesses relative value, and identifies associated risks. AI feasibility is examined against market trends, competitor positioning, and internal capabilities.

**Key Activities:**
- Market landscape analysis
- Competitor AI capability benchmarking
- Internal readiness assessment
- Risk identification and preliminary mitigation planning

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear understanding of AI opportunity space
- Documented feasibility assessment
- Stakeholder alignment on exploration priorities

### 2. Pilot Phase

Specific, small-scale AI solutions are implemented in controlled environments. System performance and user reception are measured before broader deployment.

**Key Activities:**
- Use case selection and scoping
- Proof of concept development
- Performance measurement against defined KPIs
- User feedback collection and analysis

**Success Criteria:**
- Demonstrated technical viability
- Quantified performance improvements
- Identified integration challenges
- User acceptance validated

### 3. Implementation Phase

AI integrates into company processes and departments. This phase involves workflow reengineering, systems integration, and addressing emerging ethical considerations.

**Key Activities:**
- Process redesign and workflow integration
- Technical infrastructure scaling
- Change management programme execution
- Ethical framework implementation

**Success Criteria:**
- Successful cross-departmental deployment
- Measurable operational improvements
- Workforce adaptation to new processes
- Governance mechanisms operational

### 4. Adoption Phase

Technology becomes fully integrated within the organisation. AI transitions from project status to standard operating procedure.

**Key Activities:**
- Full organisational rollout
- Performance optimisation
- Capability building across workforce
- Integration with existing systems and processes

**Success Criteria:**
- Organisation-wide utilisation
- Embedded in daily operations
- Self-sustaining without project-level oversight
- Documented best practices and procedures

### 5. Sustainability Phase

Post-adoption monitoring and continuous improvement. Systems are fine-tuned and integrated with emerging technologies and evolving business models.

**Key Activities:**
- Continuous performance monitoring
- System refinement based on operational data
- Technology refresh planning
- Alignment with evolving business strategy

**Success Criteria:**
- Sustained performance levels
- Continuous improvement trajectory
- Adaptability to changing requirements
- Long-term value realisation
